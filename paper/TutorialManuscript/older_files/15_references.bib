	abstract = {The weighted ensemble (WE) methodology orchestrates quasi-independent parallel simulations run with intermittent communication that can enhance sampling of rare events such as protein conformational changes, folding, and binding. The WE strategy can achieve superlinear scaling—the unbiased estimation of key observables such as rate constants and equilibrium state populations to greater precision than would be possible with ordinary parallel simulation. WE software can be used to control any dynamics engine, such as standard molecular dynamics and cell-modeling packages. This article reviews the theoretical basis of WE and goes on to describe successful applications to a number of complex biological processes—protein conformational transitions, (un)binding, and assembly processes, as well as cell-scale processes in systems biology. We furthermore discuss the challenges that need to be overcome in the next phase of WE methodological development. Overall, the combined advances in WE methodology and software have enabled the simulation of long-timescale processes that would otherwise not be practical on typical computing resources using standard simulation.},

	abstract = {A new method, weighted-ensemble Brownian dynamics, is proposed for the simulation of protein-association reactions and other events whose frequencies of outcomes are constricted by free energy barriers. The method features a weighted ensemble of trajectories in configuration space with energy levels dictating the proper correspondence between "particles" and probability. Instead of waiting a very long time for an unlikely event to occur, the probability packets are split, and small packets of probability are allowed to diffuse almost immediately into regions of configuration space that are less likely to be sampled. The method has been applied to the Northrup and Erickson (1992) model of docking-type diffusionlimited reactions and yields reaction rate constants in agreement with those obtained by direct Brownian simulation, but at a fraction of the CPU time (10-4 to 10-3, depending on the model). Because the method is essentially a variant of standard Brownian dynamics algorithms, it is anticipated that weighted-ensemble Brownian dynamics, in conjunction with biophysical force models, can be applied to a large class of association reactions of interest to the biophysics community.},

	abstract = {Despite the development of massively parallel computing hardware including inexpensive graphics processing units (GPUs), it has remained infeasible to simulate the folding of atomistic proteins at room temperature using conventional molecular dynamics (MD) beyond the microsecond scale. Here, we report the folding of atomistic, implicitly solvated protein systems with folding times τ ranging from ∼10 μs to ∼100 ms using the weighted ensemble (WE) strategy in combination with GPU computing. Starting from an initial structure or set of structures, WE organizes an ensemble of GPU-accelerated MD trajectory segments via intermittent pruning and replication events to generate statistically unbiased estimates of rate constants for rare events such as folding; no biasing forces are used. Although the variance among atomistic WE folding runs is signiﬁcant, multiple independent runs are used to reduce and quantify statistical uncertainty. Folding times are estimated directly from WE probability ﬂux and from history-augmented Markov analysis of the WE data. Three systems were examined: NTL9 at low solvent viscosity (yielding τf = 0.8−9 μs), NTL9 at water-like viscosity (τf = 0.2−2 ms), and Protein G at low viscosity (τf = 3−200 ms). In all cases, the folding time, uncertainty, and ensemble properties could be estimated from WE simulation; for Protein G, this characterization required signiﬁcantly less overall computing than would be required to observe a single folding event with conventional MD simulations. Our results suggest that the use and calibration of force ﬁelds and solvent models for precise estimation of kinetic quantities is becoming feasible.},

          , 
            
              A grand challenge in the field of biophysics has been the complete characterization of protein–protein binding processes at atomic resolution. This characterization requires the direct simulation of binding pathways starting from the initial, unbound state and proceeding through states that are too transient to be captured by experiment. Here, we applied the weighted ensemble path sampling strategy to orchestrate atomistic simulation of protein–protein binding pathways. Our simulation generated 203 fully-continuous and independent pathways along with rate constants for the binding process involving the barnase and barstar proteins. Results reveal multiple binding pathways along a “funnel-like” free energy landscape in which the formation of the “encounter complex” intermediate is rate-limiting followed by a relatively rapid rearrangement of the encounter complex to the bound state. Among all diffusional collisions, only ∼11\% were productive. In the most probable binding pathways, the proteins rotated to a large extent (likely
              via
              electrostatic steering) in order to collide productively followed by “rolling” of the proteins along each other's binding interfaces to reach the bound state. Consistent with experiment, R59 was identified as the most kinetically important barnase residue for the binding process. Furthermore, protein desolvation occurs late in the binding process during the rearrangement of the encounter complex to the bound state. Notably, the positions of crystallographic water molecules that bridge hydrogen bonds between barnase and barstar are occupied in the bound-state ensemble. Our simulation was completed in a month using 1600 CPU cores at a time, demonstrating that it is now practical to carry out atomistic simulations of protein–protein binding.},

	abstract = {Replica exchange (RE) is a generalized ensemble simulation method for accelerating the exploration of free-energy landscapes, which define many challenging problems in computational biophysics, including protein folding and binding. Although temperature RE (T-RE) is a parallel simulation technique whose implementation is relatively straightforward, kinetics and the approach to equilibrium in the T-RE ensemble are very complicated; there is much to learn about how to best employ T-RE to protein folding and binding problems. We have constructed a kinetic network model for RE studies of protein folding and used this reduced model to carry out “simulations of simulations” to analyze how the underlying temperature dependence of the conformational kinetics and the basic parameters of RE (e.g., the number of replicas, the RE rate, and the temperature spacing) all interact to affect the number of folding transitions observed. When protein folding follows anti-Arrhenius kinetics, we observe a speed limit for the number of folding transitions observed at the low temperature of interest, which depends on the maximum of the harmonic mean of the folding and unfolding transition rates at high temperature. The results shown here for the network RE model suggest ways to improve atomic-level RE simulations such as the use of “training” simulations to explore some aspects of the temperature dependence for folding of the atomic-level models before performing RE studies.},

Results reveal that the MAB binning scheme, despite its simplicity, is more efficient than a manual, fixed binning scheme in generating transitions over large free energy barriers, generating a diversity of pathways, estimating rate constants, and sampling conformations.

Unfortunately, WE simulations of sufficiently complex systems will not relax to steady state on observed simulation times. Here, we show that a postsimulation clustering of molecular configurations into “microbins” using methods developed in the Markov State Model (MSM) community can yield unbiased kinetics from WE data before steady-state convergence of the WE simulation itself. Because WE trajectories are directional and not equilibrium distributed, the history-augmented MSM (haMSM) formulation can be used, which yields the mean first-passage time (MFPT) without bias for arbitrarily small lag times. Accurate kinetics can be obtained while bypassing the often prohibitive convergence requirements of the nonequilibrium weighted ensemble. We validate the method in a simple diffusive process on a two-dimensional (2D) random energy landscape and then analyze atomistic protein folding simulations using WE molecular dynamics. We report significant progress toward the unbiased estimation of protein folding times and pathways, though key challenges remain.},

While snapshots of the ‘up’ and ‘down’ states have been obtained by cryo-electron microscopy and cryo-electron tomagraphy, details of the RBD-opening transition evade experimental characterization. Here over 130 µs of weighted ensemble simulations of the fully glycosylated spike ectodomain allow us to characterize more than 300 continuous, kinetically unbiased RBD-opening pathways. Together with ManifoldEM analysis of cryo-electron microscopy data and biolayer interferometry experiments, we reveal a gating role for the N-glycan at position N343, which facilitates RBD opening. Residues D405, R408 and D427 also participate. The atomic-level characterization of the glycosylated spike activation mechanism provided herein represents a landmark study for ensemble pathway simulations and offers a foundation for understanding the fundamental mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 viral entry and infection.},

For this reason, a number of methods have been developed to model spatial heterogeneity and incorporated into widely used modeling platforms. Unfortunately, the standard approaches for specifying and simulating chemical reaction networks become untenable when dealing with multi-state, multi-component systems that are characterized by combinatorial complexity. To address this issue, we developed MCell-R, a framework that extends the particle-based spatial Monte Carlo simulator, MCell, with the rule-based model specification and simulation capabilities provided by BioNetGen and NFsim. The BioNetGen syntax enables the specification of biomolecules as structured objects whose components can have different internal states that represent such features as covalent modification and conformation and which can bind components of other molecules to form molecular complexes. The network-free simulation algorithm used by NFsim enables efficient simulation of rule-based models even when the size of the network implied by the biochemical rules is too large to enumerate explicitly, which frequently occurs in detailed models of biochemical signaling. The result is a framework that can efficiently simulate systems characterized by combinatorial complexity at the level of spatially-resolved individual molecules over biologically relevant time and length scales.},

When the alternative models are optimized subject to fundamental thermodynamic constraints, they fail to match the kinetic ability of the rotary mechanism over a wide range of conditions, particularly under low-energy conditions. We used a physically interpretable, closed-form solution for the steady-state rate for an arbitrary chemical cycle, which clarifies kinetic effects of complex free-energy landscapes.

This scheme enables rate-constant estimation from shorter trajectories by incorporating the probability distribution of event durations, or barrier-crossing times, from a simulation. We have applied the RED scheme to weighted ensemble simulations of a variety of rare-event processes that range in complexity: residue-level simulations of protein conformational switching, atomistic simulations of Na+/Cl− association in explicit solvent, and atomistic simulations of protein–protein association in explicit solvent. Rate constants were estimated with up to 50\% greater efficiency than the original weighted ensemble scheme. Importantly, our scheme accounts for the systematic error that results from statistical bias toward the observation of events with short durations and reweights the event duration distribution accordingly. The RED scheme is relevant to any simulation strategy that involves unbiased trajectories of similar length to the most probable event duration, including weighted ensemble, milestoning, and standard simulations as well as the construction of Markov state models.},

	abstract = {Conventional molecular dynamics simulations are incapable of sampling many important interactions in biomolecular systems due to their high dimensionality and rough energy landscapes. To observe rare events and calculate transition rates in these systems, enhanced sampling is a necessity. In particular, the study of ligand-protein interactions necessitates a diverse ensemble of protein conformations and transition states, and for many systems, this occurs on prohibitively long time scales. Previous strategies such as WExplore that can be used to determine these types of ensembles are hindered by problems related to the regioning of conformational space. Here, we propose a novel, regionless, enhanced sampling method that is based on the weighted ensemble framework. In this method, a value referred to as "trajectory variation" is optimized after each cycle through cloning and merging operations. This method allows for a more consistent measurement of observables and broader sampling resulting in the efficient exploration of previously unexplored conformations. We demonstrate the performance of this algorithm with the N-dimensional random walk and the unbinding of the trypsin-benzamidine system. The system is analyzed using conformation space networks, the residence time of benzamidine is confirmed, and a new unbinding pathway for the trypsin-benzamidine system is found. We expect that resampling of ensembles by variation optimization will be a useful general tool to broadly explore free energy landscapes.},

The derivation is based on standard path-integral (path probability) ideas, but recasts the weighted-ensemble approach as simple “resampling” in path space. Similar reasoning indicates that arbitrary nonstatic binning procedures, which merely guide the resampling process, are also valid. Numerical examples confirm the claims, including the use of bins which can adaptively find the target state in a simple model.},

	abstract = {Ligand (un)binding kinetics is being recognized as a determinant of drug specificity and efficacy in an increasing number of systems. However, the calculation of kinetics and the simulation of drug unbinding is more difficult than computing thermodynamic quantities, such as binding free energies. Here we present the first full simulations of an unbinding process at pharmacologically relevant time scales (11 min), without the use of biasing forces, detailed prior knowledge, or specialized processors using the weighted ensemble based algorithm, WExplore. These simulations show the inhibitor TPPU unbinding from its enzyme target soluble epoxide hydrolase, which is a clinically relevant target that has attracted interest in kinetics optimization in order to increase efficacy. We make use of conformation space networks that allow us to conceptualize unbinding not just as a linear process, but as a network of interconnected states that connect the bound and unbound states. This allows us to visualize patterns in hydrogen-bonding, solvation, and nonequilibrium free energies, without projection onto progress coordinates. The topology and layout of the network reveal multiple unbinding pathways, and other rare events, such as the reversal of ligand orientation within the binding site. Furthermore, we make a prediction of the transition state ensemble, using transition path theory, and identify protein–ligand interactions which are stabilizing to the transition state. Additionally, we uncover trends in ligand and binding site solvation that corroborate experimental evidence from more classical structure kinetics relationships and generate new questions as to the role of drug modifications in kinetics optimization. Finally, from only 6 μs of simulation time we observed 75 unbinding events from which we calculate a residence time of 42 s, and a standard error range of 23 to 280 s. This nearly encompasses the experimental residence time 11 min (660 s). In addition to the insights to sEH inhibitor unbinding, this study shows that simulations of complex processes on timescales as long as minutes are becoming feasible for more researchers to perform.},

Increasing interest in intrinsically disordered systems and the desire to target ensembles of protein conformations (rather than single structures) in drug development motivate the need for enhanced sampling algorithms that are not limited to “two-basin” problems, and can efficiently determine structural ensembles. For systems that are not well-studied, this must often be done with little or no information about the dynamics of interest. Here we present a novel strategy to determine structural ensembles that uses dynamically defined sampling regions that are organized in a hierarchical framework. It is based on the weighted ensemble algorithm, where an ensemble of copies of the system (“replicas”) is directed to new regions of configuration space through merging and cloning operations. The sampling hierarchy allows for a large number of regions to be defined, while using only a small number of replicas that can be balanced over multiple length scales. We demonstrate this algorithm on two model systems that are analytically solvable and examine the 10-residue peptide chignolin in explicit solvent. The latter system is analyzed using a configuration space network, and novel hydrogen bonds are found that facilitate folding.},

Notably, the steady-state current Jss for a source-sink system can provide the exact mean-first-passage time (MFPT) for the transition from the source to sink. Because transient nonequilibrium behavior is quantified in some modern path sampling approaches, such as the “weighted ensemble” strategy, there is strong motivation to determine bounds on Jss—and hence on the MFPT—as the system evolves in time. Here, we show that Jss is bounded from above and below by the maximum and minimum, respectively, of the current as a function of the spatial coordinate at any time t for one-dimensional systems undergoing overdamped Langevin (i.e., Smoluchowski) dynamics and for higher-dimensional Smoluchowski systems satisfying certain assumptions when projected onto a single dimension. These bounds become tighter with time, making them of potential practical utility in a scheme for estimating Jss and the long time scale kinetics of complex systems. Conceptually, the bounds result from the fact that extrema of the transient currents relax toward the steady-state current.},

However, these calculations are usually computationally expensive, and even significant computing resources may result in a small number of independent estimates spread over many orders of magnitude. Such small-sample, high “log-variance” data are not readily amenable to analysis using the standard uncertainty (i.e., “standard error of the mean”) because unphysical negative limits of confidence intervals result. Bootstrapping, a natural alternative guaranteed to yield a confidence interval within the minimum and maximum values, also exhibits a striking systematic bias of the lower confidence limit in log space. As we show, bootstrapping artifactually assigns high probability to improbably low mean values. A second alternative, the Bayesian bootstrap strategy, does not suffer from the same deficit and is more logically consistent with the type of confidence interval desired. The Bayesian bootstrap provides uncertainty intervals that are more reliable than those from the standard bootstrap method but must be used with caution nevertheless. Neither standard nor Bayesian bootstrapping can overcome the intrinsic challenge of underestimating the mean from small-size, high log-variance samples. Our conclusions are based on extensive analysis of model distributions and reanalysis of multiple independent atomistic simulations. Although we only analyze rate constants, similar considerations will apply to related calculations, potentially including highly nonlinear averages like the Jarzynski relation.},

	abstract = {We report a serious problem associated with a number of current implementations of Andersen and Langevin dynamics algorithms. When long simulations are run in many segments, it is sometimes possible to have a repeating sequence of pseudorandom numbers enter the calcuation. We show that, if the sequence repeats rapidly, the resulting artifacts can quickly denature biomolecules and are then easily detectable. However, if the sequence repeats less frequently, the artifacts become subtle and easily overlooked. We derive a formula for the underlying cause of artifacts in the case of the Langevin thermostat, and find it vanishes slowly as the inverse square root of the number of time steps per simulation segment. Numerous examples of simulation artifacts are presented, including dissociation of a tetrameric protein after 110 ns of dynamics, reductions in atomic fluctuations for a small protein in implicit solvent, altered thermodynamic properties of a box of water molecules, and changes in the transition free energies between dihedral angle conformations. Finally, in the case of strong thermocoupling, we link the observed artifacts to previous work in nonlinear dynamics and show that it is possible to drive a 20-residue, implicitly solvated protein into periodic trajectories if the thermostat is not used properly. Our findings should help other investigators re-evaluate simulations that may have been corrupted and obtain more accurate results.},

	abstract = {Passive permeability of a drug-like molecule is a critical property assayed early in a drug discovery campaign that informs a medicinal chemist how well a compound can traverse biological membranes, such as gastrointestinal epithelial or restrictive organ barriers, so it can perform a speciﬁc therapeutic function. However, the challenge that remains is the development of a method, experimental or computational, which can both determine the permeation rate and provide mechanistic insights into the transport process to help with the rational design of any given molecule. Typically, one of the following three methods are used to measure the membrane permeability: (1) experimental permeation assays acting on either artiﬁcial or natural membranes; (2) quantitative structure−permeability relationship models that rely on experimental values of permeability or related pharmacokinetic properties of a range of molecules to infer those for new molecules; and (3) estimation of permeability from the Smoluchowski equation, where free energy and diﬀusion proﬁles along the membrane normal are taken as input from large-scale molecular dynamics simulations. While all these methods provide estimates of permeation coeﬃcients, they provide very little information for guiding rational drug design. In this study, we employ a highly parallelizable weighted ensemble (WE) path sampling strategy, empowered by cloud computing techniques, to generate unbiased permeation pathways and permeability coeﬃcients for a set of drug-like molecules across a neat 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidylcholine membrane bilayer. Our WE method predicts permeability coeﬃcients that compare well to experimental values from an MDCK-LE cell line and PAMPA assays for a set of drug-like amines of varying size, shape, and ﬂexibility. Our method also yields a series of continuous permeation pathways weighted and ranked by their associated probabilities. Taken together, the ensemble of reactive permeation pathways, along with the estimate of the permeability coeﬃcient, provides a clearer picture of the microscopic underpinnings of small-molecule membrane permeation.},
