	doi = {10.1016/j.bpj.2018.09.021},
	abstract = {The interaction between a ligand and a protein involves a multitude of conformational states. To achieve a particular deeply bound pose, the ligand must search across a rough free-energy landscape with many metastable minima. Creating maps of the ligand binding landscape is a great challenge, as binding and release events typically occur on timescales that are beyond the reach of molecular simulation. The {WExplore} enhanced sampling method is well suited to build these maps because it is designed to broadly explore free-energy landscapes and is capable of simulating ligand release pathways that occur on timescales as long as minutes. {WExplore} also uses only unbiased trajectory segments, allowing for the construction of Markov state models ({MSMs}) and conformation space networks that combine the results of multiple simulations. Here, we use {WExplore} to study two bromodomain-inhibitor systems using multiple docked starting poses (Brd4-{MS}436 and Baz2B-{ICR}7) and synthesize our results using a series of {MSMs} using time-lagged independent component analysis. Ranking the starting poses by exit rate agrees with the crystal structure pose in both cases. We also predict the most stable pose using the equilibrium populations from the {MSM} but find that the prediction is not robust as a function of {MSM} parameters. The simulated trajectories are synthesized into network models that visualize the entire binding landscape for each system, and we examine transition paths between deeply bound stable states. We find that, on average, transitions between deeply bound states convert through the unbound state 81\% of the time, implying a trial-and-error approach to ligand binding. We conclude with a discussion of the implications of this result for both kinetics-based drug discovery and virtual screening pipelines that incorporate molecular dynamics.},

	shorttitle = {{REVO}},
	abstract = {Conventional molecular dynamics simulations are incapable of sampling many important interactions in biomolecular systems due to their high dimensionality and rough energy landscapes. To observe rare events and calculate transition rates in these systems, enhanced sampling is a necessity. In particular, the study of ligand-protein interactions necessitates a diverse ensemble of protein conformations and transition states, and for many systems this occurs on prohibitively long timescales. Previous strategies such as {WExplore} that can be used to determine these types of ensembles are hindered by problems related to the regioning of conformational space. Here we propose a novel, regionless, enhanced sampling method that is based on the weighted ensemble framework. In this method, a value referred to as “trajectory variation” is optimized after each cycle through cloning and merging operations. This method allows for a more consistent measurement of observables and broader sampling resulting in the efficient exploration of previously unexplored conformations. We demonstrate the performance of this algorithm with the N-dimensional random walk and the unbinding of the trypsin-benzamidine system. The system is analyzed using conformation space networks, the residence time of benzamidine is confirmed, and a new unbinding pathway for the trypsin-benzamidine system is found. We expect that {REVO} will be a useful general tool to broadly explore free energy landscapes.},

	abstract = {Umbrella sampling enforces uniform sampling of steady-state distributions that are functions of arbitrary numbers of order parameters. The key to applying such methods to nonequilibrium processes is the accumulation of fluxes between regions. A significant difference between microscopically reversible and irreversible systems is that, in the latter case, the transition path ensemble for a reaction can be significantly different for "forward" and "backward" trajectories. Here, we show how to separately treat forward and backward pathways in nonequilibrium umbrella sampling simulations by working in an extended space. In this extended space, the exact rate (for equilibrium or nonequilibrium processes) can be calculated "for free" as a flux in phase space. We compare the efficiency of this rate calculation with forward flux sampling for a two-dimensional potential and show that nonequilibrium umbrella sampling is more efficient when an intermediate is present. We show that this technique can also be used to describe steady-state limit cycles by examining a simulation of circadian oscillations. We obtain the path of the limit cycle in a space of 22 order parameters, as well as the oscillation period. The relation of our method to others is discussed. © 2009 American Institute of Physics.},

	abstract = {A key overall goal of biomolecular simulations is the characterization of "mechanism" -- the pathways through configuration space of processes such as conformational transitions and binding. Some amount of heterogeneity is intrinsic to the ensemble of pathways, in direct analogy to thermal configurational ensembles. Quantification of that heterogeneity is essential to a complete understanding of mechanism. We propose a general approach for characterizing path ensembles based on mapping individual trajectories into pathway classes whose populations and uncertainties can be analyzed as an ordinary histogram, providing a quantitative "fingerprint" of mechanism. In contrast to prior flux-based analyses used for discrete-state models, stochastic deviations from average behavior are explicitly included via direct classification of trajectories. The histogram approach, furthermore, is applicable to analysis of continuous trajectories. It enables straightforward comparison between ensembles produced by different methods or under different conditions. To implement the formulation, we develop approaches for classifying trajectories, including a clustering-based approach suitable for both continuous-space (e.g., molecular dynamics) or discrete-state (e.g., Markov state model) trajectories, as well as a "fundamental sequence" approach tailored for discrete-state trajectories but also applicable to continuous trajectories through a mapping process. We apply the pathway histogram analysis to a toy model and an extremely long atomistic molecular dynamics trajectory of protein folding.},

	abstract = {The weighted ensemble ({WE}) simulation strategy can provide unbiased sampling of non-equilibrium processes, such as molecular folding or binding. Once converged to steady state, exact kinetics can be extracted from any discrete clustering of the configuration space based on a history-dependent trajectory labeling process using any lag time. However, the convergence of {WE} to steady state may require unaffordably long simulations in complex systems. Here we show that by clustering molecular configurations into many (thousands of) microstates using methods developed in the Markov State Modeling ({MSM}) community, unbiased kinetics can be obtained from {WE} data using history-augmented Markov State Models ({haMSMs}) before steady-state convergence of the {WE} simulation itself. Because arbitrarily small lag times can be used within the exact {haMSM} formulation, accurate kinetics can be obtained with significantly less trajectory data than traditional {MSMs}, while bypassing the often prohibitive convergence requirements of the non-equilibrium weighted ensemble. We validate the method by comparison to recently obtained unbiased estimations of atomistic protein folding rates using {WE} molecular dynamics.},

This method reduces the sensitivity of rate-constant estimation to the earliest (and least typical) pathways reaching the target state by incorporating the distribution of event durations (excluding dwell time in the initial stable state) that correspond to pathways captured by the simulation. We demonstrate that the improved method enables accurate estimation of the rate constant for a protein conformational switching process using a fraction of the simulation time required by the original weighted ensemble method. Importantly, our method accounts for systematic error when using data from the entire simulation. Our method is relevant to any simulation strategy that involves unbiased trajectories of similar length to the typical event duration, including weighted ensemble and standard simulations.},

	doi = {10.1101/671172},
	abstract = {The weighted ensemble ({WE}) path sampling strategy is highly efficient in generating pathways and rate constants for rare events using atomistic molecular dynamics simulations. Here we extensively evaluated the impact of several advances to the {WE} strategy on the efficiency of computing association and dissociation rate constants (k) as well as binding affinities (K) for a set of benchmark systems, listed in order of increasing timescales of molecular association/dissociation processes: methane/methane, Na+/Cl-, and K+/18-crown-6 ether. In particular, we assessed the advantages of carrying out (i) a large set of light-weight {WE} simulations that each consist of a small number of trajectories vs. a single heavy-weight {WE} simulation that consists of a relatively large number of trajectories, (ii) equilibrium vs. steady-state {WE} simulations, (iii) history augmented Markov State Model ({haMSM}) post-simulation analysis of equilibrium sets of trajectories, and (iv) tracking of trajectory history (the state last visited) during the dynamics propagation of equilibrium {WE} simulations. Provided that state definitions are known in advance, our results reveal that heavy-weight, steady-state {WE} simulations are the most efficient protocol for calculating k and K values. If states are not strictly defined in advance, heavy-weight, equilibrium {WE} simulations are the most efficient protocol. This efficiency can be further improved with the inclusion of trajectory history during dynamics propagation. In addition, applying the {haMSM} post-simulation analysis enhances the efficiency of both steady-state and equilibrium {WE} simulations. Recommendations of appropriate {WE} protocols are made according to the goals of the simulations (e.g. to efficiently calculate rate constants and/or generate a diverse set of pathways).},
